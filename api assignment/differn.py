# Ques.4- What is a difference between library
#  and API . Figure it out with examples.
# Ans.4
       # My view is that when I speak of an API, it means only the parts that are exposed to the programmer.
       # If I speak of a 'library' then I also mean everything that is working 
       # "under the hood", though part of the library nevertheless.


#library example
import time
#above i importing time library 
  

  #api

  import tweepy
